# RedBlackTree-Data-Structure
barebone structure for RedBlackTree stored in repository for future use

UW Madison CS400 project.

Red Black Tree is a self balancing tree structure with rotations determined by red-black child violations and the overall black node heights.

The average time complexity for insertion, removal, and search is all O(log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
